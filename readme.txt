More than one testimonials shortcode or widget instance can be displayed at a time on a page. Additionally, with shortcodes and theme functions, you can display a short or long list or rotation of testimonials anywhere you need. 

Through categories and tagging, you can create organizational structures. Using categories for products, projects and services you can then apply tagging for further classification.

As an example, create a **Portfolio** category and then use tags to identify _web_, _magazine_, _media_, _public_, _enterprise_, or other niches. Then configure the Testimonial instance to show only **Portfolio** testimonials with the _public_ and _enterprise_ tags. In another Testimonial instance, you can also select only **Portfolio** testimonials, but then allow _web_ and _media_ tags.

For easy custom styling, each testimonial widget has its own CSS class identifier.

Widgets display content sans `wpautop` formatting. This means there's no forced paragraph breaks unless the content specifically contains them. If needed, you can enable `wpautop` via the "Keep whitespace?" option.

The single testimonial view supports image, source, title, location, email, company and URL details with optional Review schema.

= Shortcode and Widget Options =

Please keep in mind that inheritance affects options. This means that changes made to Aihrus Testimonials > Settings will not affect current widget instance options. You must change the widget instance manually. However, if you create a new widget instance, then the global settings will apply.

Further, global settings are the baseline for shortcodes. If you want to alter the shortcode appearance, then alter the shortcode options directly.
